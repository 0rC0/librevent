### What's interoperability ? 

Interoperability (_from wikipedia_) is a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions. While the term was initially defined for information technology or systems engineering services to allow for information exchange, a broader definition takes into account social, political, and organizational factors that impact system to system performance. Hence interoperability involves the task of building coherent services for users when the individual components are technically different and managed by different organizations.

Critical mass is the reason why Facebook remain dominan despite none of their records justify this. Librevent claim is:

## By liberating events from Facebook to Fediverse we might help migration on federated platform.
